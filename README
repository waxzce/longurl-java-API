This is a very simple java API for longurl.org
I don't care about this project but it can be helpfullâ€¦

a build is in the dist directory

depend of GSON (json parser) : http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/

use like this :

LongUrl u = new LongUrl("yourShortUrl")
u.getLongUrl(); // return string with the long url
u.getTitle(); // return string with page title


code is MIT licenced

contact me for improvements
